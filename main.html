          <p>Standing at the edge of the plane preparing to jump had my heart racing like crazy. Pretty sure my life flashed before my eyes at this point.</p>

          <p>This is the point of no return. I had to make a banana form with my body and hope I didn't start tumbling in circles as I fell back to the earth.</p>

          <h2>The Chill Stage</h2>
          <p>Parachute out. Slow fall back to the earth. This moment was very calm and peaceful as we turned in the air and watched all the toy cars and building operate on the ground. Mission Jump out of plane from 15,000. Success!</p>
